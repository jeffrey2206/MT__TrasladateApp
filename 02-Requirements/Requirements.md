-	the system will provide information on traffic at all times in which we will use technology such as DeepMind
-	The system will provide an approximate duration of the journey to the user's destination
-	The system will choose the best route for the trajectory depending on the weather you are in at the time..
-	The system will provide us with a fare (not fixed) which will depend on our destination and the number of units we must take to reach our destination.
