TRANSLATE APP

The application to be made is specifically for taxi and bus drivers and companies.
This application will be more useful so that we can see the time that we could take from one place to another by satellite recording in a database the traffic that exists on the routes in order to know the best routes and the time we could take the route in the one that we would find less traffic and there is also the paid version in which it has a monthly cost and it has privileges such as:
-no annoying advertisements
-a database for the user
-Visualization of traffic in real time through satellite tracking
-Visualization of people in real time by chosen routes

THINGS WE WILL DEPEND ON AND USE IN THIS APP
-Advertising help so that people and companies can know about this app
-legal operating permits to locate the traffic and established routes via satellite
-investment so that you can grow faster in order to monetize the app
-access to the satellite network of routes and traffic
-staff specialized in software development, networking, marketing, programming, law.
