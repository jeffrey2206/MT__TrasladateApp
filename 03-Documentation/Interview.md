1.- What is the busiest time of the day?
Generally there is much more affluence in the peak hours when people leave their homes to work, study or do some activity in their day, which in the common schedule is from 6:30 am to 8:00 am after that time there is not much influx of people: It is also very common that the unit fills up at night because people return home and there is the possibility that at some stops it is not possible to take more people because the unit is completely full, the usual time when this happens is from 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm. 

2.- At what time and in what part of the route is road traffic more frequent?
Regarding road traffic it is very unpredictable to say in what part and at what time there is traffic because of various factors such as crashes or landslides, but in the most frequent stops where there is traffic is in the Loma, Chaguarquingo, and El Trebol both in the morning and at night.

3.- How much would you be willing to pay for an unlimited premium service of an app?
First of all, if the application would be focused on helping us take better routes with schedules that help us enter more people, I would be willing to pay about $ 5 per month for the premium application.
  
4.- how much would you be willing to charge for advertising an application?
in this case it would be more convenient to charge the same as the application will be paid monthly.

5-How many times a day do passengers ask you to notify them of a stop?
Usually every time I make a turn on the established route I am asked about 8 people more or less and usually it is always the same stop.

6-What is the tendency of people who do not know their stop, young people or adults or senior citizens?
Young people, I consider that young people do not know their exact stop due to the little knowledge about the city and the lack of information about the means of transportation.

7.-What is the schedule with which the buses of your company work? Are there different schedules for more specific routes?
In our company we work with 3 types of schedules, one which works from Monday to Friday, which is from 5:30 in the morning until 10:00 p.m., then on Saturdays we work from 5:40 in the morning until 9:40 p.m., Sundays and holidays work from 5:40 to 20:40.
Answering your other question, you do not really work with different schedules for any other type of route, there is only a minimal variation which concerns the departure time of each bus, if the company works according to the 3 schedules already established, since it is taken Take into account the time it takes to travel the bus on its two routes, thus working with a rigorous schedule.

8.-What are the routes your company works with? What is the name of each route?
Our company currently works with 3 routes which are Obrero Independiente-Comuna, the Balc√≥n del Valle-Primavera route and the last one is Eloy de Alfaro - Obrero Independiente - Rosaspamba, which each has about 55 stops in its two routes. Each route works with the schedules established by the company and taking into account the respective traffic on its route.

9.-How many units work approximately for each route?
The regular average that is driven by route is 4 to 10 units, which leave at different times to have greater coverage. The number of units is dependent on the influx of people which must be covered.

10.-How many drivers does your cooperative have to cover the number of units? Taking into account that free days and vacations are handled.
To cover the number of units and routes, we adhere to what the law says. That each bus must have at least two drivers on duty to cover the entire schedule of the routes and also cover days off and vacations.
